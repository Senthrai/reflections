---When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
///When working with others users on a project.

---Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
///It would be a problem to have more code without knowing it.

---Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
///Forks : Only to GitHub -> GitHub, clone a repository
   Clones: Can be on local and on GitHub -> Clone a repository, and put a remote on the origin.
   Branches : Nothing to do with the others, a branch is when you want to create something new that is not directly on the branch master.
