---When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
///When working with others users on a project.

---Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
///It would be a problem to have more code without knowing it.

---Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
///Forks : Only to GitHub -> GitHub, clone a repository
   Clones: Can be on local and on GitHub -> Clone a repository, and put a remote on the origin.
   Branches : Nothing to do with the others, a branch is when you want to create something new that is not directly on the branch master.

---What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
///We know what was the last commit we got on our last pull/fetch.

---How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
///Without Git/Hub, I would have to manually share the file via USB/mail/etc... Git/Hub seems to be way easier when we need to collaborate.

---When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
///When working on extra feature. Having one unique branch, allows us to easily known what changes the last commit bring. 
Having multiples branches gives us more room to work without disturbing the others.
