---What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
///Git prepare a hidden directory. To know where the commits will be.

---How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
///The staging area serves as a temporary platform between the working directory and the respository.
It keeps the other platforms cleaner.

 ---How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 ///Check the status before committing anything, or maybe there's an option to lock the size of the commit.

 ---What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
 ///When adding extra features to a project, it would help to know what was the main project. To maintain the different codes separated.
